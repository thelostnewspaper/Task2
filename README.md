Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset
   

Overview
   

This repository contains a Python script that performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The purpose of this analysis is to understand the dataset through statistical summaries and visualizations, identify patterns, trends, anomalies, and key relationships between features. This foundational step is crucial for preparing the data for subsequent machine learning models.    

Features of the EDA Script
   

Summary Statistics
Calculates basic statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for numerical features.    

Histograms
Visualizes the distribution of numeric variables like Age and Fare to understand their spread and detect skewness.    

Boxplots
Displays the distribution of Age and Fare grouped by survival status to identify outliers and compare distributions between groups.    

Pairplots
Shows pairwise relationships between selected numerical features, colored by survival outcome, to visualize potential correlations or patterns.    

Correlation Matrix
Provides a heatmap displaying correlation coefficients between numerical features to identify strong or weak relationships and multicollinearity.    

Basic Data Insights
Calculates survival rates by gender and passenger class to draw preliminary inferences from the data.    

Tools Used
   

Python 3
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
   
How to Use
   

Download the Titanic dataset (train.csv) and place it in your working directory.
Run the Python script eda_titanic.py to perform the analysis.
Review printed summary statistics and visualizations generated by the script.    
Dataset
   

The Titanic dataset is available for download from Kaggle Titanic Competition.
